# Learn GPU particles

This repository is a place for me to practice GPU programming to simulate particles with GPUs. Any kind of feedback is very welcome, in particular advice how to improve performance.

I follow mainly the [10 minute physics by Matthias MÃ¼ller](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/tenMinutePhysics/index.html):

- `16-GPUCloth.jl` is based on https://github.com/matthias-research/pages/blob/master/tenMinutePhysics/16-GPUCloth.py.
